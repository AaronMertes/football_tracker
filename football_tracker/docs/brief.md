# Project Brief: Football Play Tracker

*Generated from brainstorming session on [DATE]*

## Executive Summary

A web-based application for tracking offensive American football plays with predictive analytics, designed for fans who want to analyze games like Pat Kirwan's "Moving the Chains" methodology but with modern technology. The app will capture play-by-play data, automatically calculate down and distance, track player statistics, and provide real-time predictions for upcoming plays using modern web technologies with offline capability and voice input.

**Primary Problem:** Fans lack efficient digital tools for advanced game analysis and play prediction during live games.

**Target Market:** Football fans interested in deep game analysis and predictive play-calling insights.

**Key Value Proposition:** Fast, simple data entry combined with real-time predictive analytics for enhanced game understanding and analysis.

## Problem Statement

Football fans who want to perform advanced game analysis currently rely on manual note-taking or expensive professional tools. The current state involves:

- **Pain Points:** Slow manual tracking methods, lack of real-time insights, difficulty maintaining consistent data across games
- **Impact:** Fans miss opportunities to understand play-calling patterns and game strategy in real-time
- **Existing Solutions:** Professional coaching software is expensive and complex, while manual methods are time-consuming and error-prone
- **Urgency:** Real-time analysis requires immediate data capture and processing during live games

## Proposed Solution

A Python-based web application with SQLite database that provides:

- **Core Concept:** Visual formation diagrams for quick personnel entry, automated down/distance calculation, intelligent inference of field position and context, and real-time predictive analytics
- **Key Differentiators:** Fan-focused interface prioritizing speed over complexity, predictive modeling based on historical data, and comprehensive season-long tracking
- **Success Factors:** Simple interface design, accurate prediction algorithms, and comprehensive data capture for meaningful analysis
- **Vision:** A tool that transforms how fans understand and analyze football games through technology
