# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Core Architecture

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the React project structure with proper organization and build configuration,
**so that** I have a solid foundation for building the football tracker application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. React application created with Vite
2. Project structure organized with components, utilities, and data models
3. ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality
4. Basic routing setup with React Router
5. localStorage utilities for data persistence
6. Responsive CSS framework or styling system configured

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create Vite React project and initial scaffold (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Verify dev server runs and builds successfully
- [ ] Establish project structure under `app/src` (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create `pages`, `components`, `hooks`, `data`, `services`, `utils` folders
  - [ ] Add base `Home` page
- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Ensure lints pass on CI and locally
- [ ] Setup React Router with at least Home and Game Setup routes (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Verify navigation works
- [ ] Implement `StorageService` wrapper around `localStorage` (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add typed get/set helpers
- [ ] Integrate TailwindCSS (or chosen CSS system) and basic theme tokens (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Verify responsive styles load

## Dev Notes
