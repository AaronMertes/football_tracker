# Story 1.2: Game Setup and Team Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to set up a new game with team information and initial game state,
**so that** I can begin tracking plays for a specific game.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Game setup screen with team name entry
2. Game initialization with default field position (20-yard line)
3. Game state management with localStorage persistence
4. Ability to load existing games from localStorage
5. Game list view for season tracking

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build `GameSetup` page UI (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement `useGameState` hook for CRUD and selection (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Persist games and currentGameId to localStorage
- [x] Initialize new game with default metadata and structures (AC: 2)
- [x] Render games list with load/delete actions (AC: 5)
- [x] Wire navigation from Home to Game Setup

## Dev Notes
- Source: `docs/prd.md#Story 1.2: Game Setup and Team Management`
- Use `StorageService` for persistence
- Default field position will be used downstream on play entry

## Testing
- Create, load, and delete games; verify persistence across reloads
- Validate current game indicator updates

## Change Log
- Draft created from PRD
