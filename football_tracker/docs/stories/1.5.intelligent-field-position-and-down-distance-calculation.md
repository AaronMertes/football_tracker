# Story 1.5: Intelligent Field Position and Down/Distance Calculation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the system to automatically calculate field position, down, and distance based on play results,
**so that** I don't have to manually track these complex calculations during fast-paced games.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Automatic down/distance calculation based on play results
2. Field position tracking with yard line and side of field
3. Intelligent inference of next play's starting position
4. User override capability for edge cases
5. Series end detection and new series management

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement calculation utilities for down/distance and position (AC: 1, 2)
- [x] Update `PlayEntry` to compute next suggested state (AC: 3)
- [x] Add override UI where needed (AC: 4)
- [x] Series management hooks and helpers (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- Source: `docs/prd.md#Story 1.5: Intelligent Field Position and Down/Distance Calculation`

## Testing
- Validate calculations for common scenarios
- Verify overrides persist
