# Story 1.3: Formation Selection Interface

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to quickly select personnel groupings (21, 12, etc.) through a visual interface,
**so that** I can efficiently track formation data during live games.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Visual formation selection modal with common personnel groupings
2. Quick selection buttons for 21, 12, 11, 22, 20, 02 formations
3. Formation data stored with each play
4. Formation history tracking for analysis
5. Custom formation entry option for edge cases

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build `FormationModal` with common formations and custom input (AC: 1, 2, 5)
- [x] Integrate modal with Play Entry screen (AC: 3)
- [x] Persist formation as part of play object (AC: 3)
- [x] Prepare place for historical view (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Source: `docs/prd.md#Story 1.3: Formation Selection Interface`
- Maintain simple string representation (e.g., "21") for MVP

## Testing
- Open modal, select formation, save; verify stored with play
- Enter custom formation; verify captured
