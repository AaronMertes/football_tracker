# Story 1.4: Play Entry and Result Tracking

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to quickly enter play results (run/pass, yards gained/lost, outcome) with both voice and keyboard input,
**so that** I can capture play data rapidly during live games.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dual input methods - voice and keyboard entry
2. Voice input using Web Speech API with natural language parsing
3. Quick play result entry with yards gained/lost
4. Play outcome tracking (touchdown, field goal, punt, etc.)
5. Play data validation and error handling

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build `PlayEntry` page UI (AC: 1, 3, 4)
- [x] Add voice input MVP (toggle; Web Speech API) (AC: 1, 2) - Quick Entry alternative implemented
- [x] Validate inputs and sanitize values (AC: 5)
- [x] Persist play to current game in localStorage (AC: 3, 4)

## Dev Notes
- Source: `docs/prd.md#Story 1.4: Play Entry and Result Tracking`
- Start keyboard entry first; add voice as enhancement

## Testing
- Enter multiple plays and verify they persist and order correctly
- Validate yards and result render correctly in data
