## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
**Frameworks:** React (frontend), Create React App or Vite (build tool)
**Database:** localStorage (local development), potential Firebase Firestore (future cloud deployment)
**Infrastructure:** Local development server, potential Firebase hosting (future)
**External Dependencies:** Web Speech API (voice input), React Router (navigation), potential charting library (analytics)

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy:** Start with localStorage for immediate local development and testing. Design data structures to be compatible with future Firebase Firestore migration for cloud deployment.

**API Integration Strategy:** No external APIs required for MVP. Voice input will use browser's Web Speech API. Future integration points designed for potential broadcast data APIs.

**Frontend Integration Strategy:** React-based single-page application with component-based architecture. Modular design to support future feature additions and potential mobile app development.

**Testing Integration Strategy:** Jest and React Testing Library for unit and component testing. Manual testing for voice input and game scenarios.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach:** Feature-based organization with shared components, utilities, and data models. Clear separation between game logic, UI components, and data persistence.

**Naming Conventions:** React component naming (PascalCase), utility functions (camelCase), constants (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE), CSS classes (kebab-case).

**Coding Standards:** ESLint configuration for code quality, Prettier for formatting, TypeScript consideration for future type safety.

**Documentation Standards:** JSDoc comments for complex functions, README for setup and usage, inline comments for game logic and business rules.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration:** Create React App or Vite for development and production builds. Environment-specific configurations for local vs. cloud deployment.

**Deployment Strategy:** Local development with npm start, potential Firebase hosting for future cloud deployment. Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline functionality.

**Monitoring and Logging:** Browser console logging for development, potential Firebase Analytics for future usage tracking.

**Configuration Management:** Environment variables for API keys and configuration, localStorage for user preferences and game data.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- Web Speech API browser compatibility issues
- localStorage size limitations for large datasets
- Performance degradation with complex game state management

**Integration Risks:**
- Voice input accuracy and parsing reliability
- Data migration complexity when moving to cloud storage
- Browser compatibility across different devices and platforms

**Deployment Risks:**
- Build process complexity for different environments
- PWA offline functionality reliability
- Data backup and recovery for localStorage

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement fallback keyboard input for voice recognition failures
- Design modular data structures for easy migration
- Comprehensive testing across multiple browsers and devices
- Regular data export capabilities for backup
