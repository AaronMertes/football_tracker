# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Architecture

**Epic Goal:** Build the foundational architecture and core data models for the Football Play Tracker application.

**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up the React project with proper architecture and tooling so that I have a solid foundation for building the football tracker application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] React application created with Vite (faster than CRA)
- [ ] TypeScript configuration for type safety
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality
- [ ] Project structure: `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/services/`, `src/utils/`, `src/data/`
- [ ] localStorage service layer implemented
- [ ] Basic routing with React Router
- [ ] Responsive CSS framework (Tailwind CSS recommended)
- [ ] PWA capabilities configured

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use Vite for faster development experience
- Implement localStorage service with error handling
- Set up TypeScript for better code quality
- Configure PWA manifest for offline capability

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] localStorage utilities work across browser sessions
- [ ] Responsive design works on desktop and mobile
- [ ] PWA can be installed and works offline

## Story 1.2: Core Data Models and State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement the core data models and state management so that the application can properly track game data and maintain state.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Game, Play, Player, FieldPosition data models implemented
- [ ] Centralized state management with React Context
- [ ] Custom hooks: `useGameState`, `useVoiceInput`, `usePredictions`
- [ ] Data validation utilities for all models
- [ ] localStorage persistence layer for all data types
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

**Technical Requirements:**
```typescript
interface Game {
  id: string;
  homeTeam: string;
  awayTeam: string;
  date: Date;
  plays: Play[];
  players: Player[];
  metadata: GameMetadata;
}

interface Play {
  id: string;
  gameId: string;
  playNumber: number;
  formation: string;
  playType: 'run' | 'pass';
  yards: number;
  result: PlayResult;
  fieldPosition: FieldPosition;
  down: number;
  distance: number;
  playerStats: PlayerStats[];
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All data models are properly typed
- [ ] State management handles all game scenarios
- [ ] Data persists correctly in localStorage
- [ ] Validation prevents invalid data entry
