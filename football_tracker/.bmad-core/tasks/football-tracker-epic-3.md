## Story 3.2: Play Entry and Result Tracking

**User Story:** As a user, I want to quickly enter play results (run/pass, yards gained/lost, outcome) with both voice and keyboard input so that I can capture play data rapidly during live games.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Dual input methods - voice and keyboard entry
- [x] Voice input using Web Speech API with natural language parsing
- [x] Quick play result entry with yards gained/lost
- [x] Play outcome tracking (touchdown, field goal, punt, etc.)
- [x] Play data validation and error handling
- [x] Play history display on main screen

**Technical Requirements:**
- âœ… Implement `VoiceInput` component with Web Speech API
- âœ… Create `PlayEntry` component with keyboard fallback
- âœ… Add natural language parsing for voice input
- âœ… Implement play validation and error handling
- âœ… Create play history display component

**Subtasks:**
- [x] Play Entry UI Component: Design and implement a user-friendly Play Entry form with fields/buttons for play type, yards, and outcome. Ensure fast, minimal-click workflow.
- [x] Keyboard Input Handling: Implement keyboard-based data entry for all play fields, with validation and error messages.
- [x] Voice Input Integration: Integrate Web Speech API for voice input, implement natural language parsing, and provide real-time feedback with user confirmation/editing.
- [x] Play Data Validation: Validate all play data before saving, including edge cases (penalties, turnovers).
- [x] Play Persistence: Save play data to local state and localStorage, ensuring correct game/sequence association.
- [x] Play History Display: Display a list/table of entered plays for the current game, with review/edit/delete options.
- [x] Error Handling and User Feedback: Provide clear feedback for successful entry, errors, or voice input issues. Ensure robust UI.
- [x] Accessibility and Speed Optimization: Ensure all controls are keyboard accessible and optimized for minimal clicks/taps and fast entry during live games.

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] Voice input accurately captures play data
- [x] Keyboard entry works as reliable fallback
- [x] Play data is properly stored and retrievable
- [x] Error handling prevents invalid data entry

**Dev Agent Record:**
- Agent Model Used: James (Developer)
- Debug Log References: 
- Completion Notes List:
- âœ… PlayEntry.tsx - Complete play entry interface with all required fields and validation
- âœ… useVoiceInput.ts - Web Speech API integration with natural language parsing
- âœ… Enhanced quick entry system with natural language parsing (faster than voice!)
- âœ… Comprehensive play validation and error handling
- âœ… Play data persistence in localStorage with proper game association
- âœ… Formation history display integrated with play entry
- âœ… All accessibility requirements met with keyboard navigation

- [x] Intelligent inference of next play's starting position
- [x] User override capability for edge cases
- [x] Series end detection and new series management
- [x] Field position display on main screen

**Technical Requirements:**
- âœ… Implement `GameEngine` service with calculation logic
- âœ… Create field position calculation utilities
- âœ… Add intelligent inference for next play position
- âœ… Implement series end detection algorithm
- âœ… Create field position display component

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] Calculations are accurate for standard plays
